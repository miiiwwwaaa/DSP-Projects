# DSP-Projects
All projects for the stem girlies. Here we upload our projects and it will update for everyone who has the Github access to it. Once you see it you can change it or edit it to your liking and upload it to our handy dandy DSP project.
You can also download github to your desktop, and Github will update the files on your computer automatically instead of of you having to constantly download the new files from the Github online. this step isn't necessary cuz it might take up some storage.
